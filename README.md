For the local play , just download the repository and open index.html file on your web browser . 

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME ? 

In game you are the Player and you have to avoid the bugs to get to the other site of the field . Once you reach the water you get some points and you back to the begining . You have to reach points as many as you can  in 3 minutes , but you have only 3 lifes . When you colide with  bugs your life-heart is gone and you back to the beginning . When there's no life hearts left the game ends and your score appears . After clicking on modal with your score the game resets and you can play again or you can use reset button on the top of the page . After every 1 minute bugs are getting faster so be careful . 
For moving you have to use keyboard arrows so for now you cant play on mobile devices .
